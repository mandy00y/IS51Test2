There is a file called Final.txt. You want to open it and count how 
many grades there are. The program will tell you how many grades there
are in the file, and the average grade. It will also tell you the 
percentage of grades that are above the average grade.

Main function will kickstart the program, open the file, and 
output 24 total grades and output average 83.25

Within the main function, the calculate_percent_above_average function
will output average percentage above average 54.17%.
